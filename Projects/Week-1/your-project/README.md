## Project Description
It's a standard game of battleshi, meant to be played from bash/terminal. You can tweak it a bit by altering the constants in the coe, but by default it'll be aa 10 * 10 board with 8 ships on it. Your interface consists of the display of your own fleet, which also shows the opposition's moves, aas well as your "radar", which shows your moves. It is turn-based, and they are refreshedd after each player's turn.

## Rules
Describe briefly the rules of the game you chose. 
The player must decide where to place his ships on the board, then decide each turn where he will fire. If a ship is hit a certain number of times, it will be sunk. The first to sink all of the opposition's ships wins.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
We first had a brainstorming session to get a general idea of how tto go about this, then I made a draft forn the board setup, which allowed Mathilde and Marc to proceed with the game's logic functions. Having made all the functions necessary for the game to work, it was a quick affair to tie it all together into the working game within a few lines.
We did not end up using all the functions, but it gave us a solid base.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
We allocated tasks using trello, and our repository is only made up of one folder.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
